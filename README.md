# Node.js Project with TypeScript and Design Patterns

This repository provides a template for setting up a **Node.js** project with **TypeScript**. It also introduces the concept of **design patterns**, offering a structured approach to solving recurring software design problems.

For an in-depth guide on design patterns, explore this [Design Patterns Cheat Sheet](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/design-patterns-cheat-sheet-when-to-use-which-design-pattern/), which explains when and how to use different design patterns effectively.

## What are Design Patterns?

**Design patterns** are reusable solutions to common problems in software design. They represent best practices refined over time and are categorized into three main types:

1. **Creational Patterns**: Focus on object creation mechanisms, ensuring that objects are created appropriately for specific situations.
   - Examples: Singleton, Factory, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype.

2. **Structural Patterns**: Deal with object composition, defining how objects and classes interact to form larger structures.
   - Examples: Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Proxy.

3. **Behavioral Patterns**: Concerned with communication between objects, encapsulating algorithms or the assignment of responsibilities.
   - Examples: Observer, Strategy, Command, Chain of Responsibility, State, Mediator.

Using design patterns improves code readability, reduces redundancy, and enhances maintainability.
